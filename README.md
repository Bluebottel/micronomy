# micronomy

A midleware and alternative webgui to access Maconomy.

# Usage

Either wait until the webservice is published and point you browser at
it; or run it locally.

To run it locally you can either install Rakudo and the required
modules or make sure you have a working Docker installation and build
and run the Dockerfile. Though the Dockerfile isn't actually done
either ...
